# HackVictoria

Chris Hampu & Aman Bhayani

All of our work was done in the Cloud9 real time IDE which was synced directly to this git repo, so there isn't much in terms 
of Git history, and it doesn't exactly show individual contributions. On the plus side, it made collaboration together very very
easy, and we didn't have any merge commit issues, as usually would happen with hackathons.

In terms of familiarity with web code, I myself (Chris) have a pretty good understanding of Javascript, but have only been working
with ReactJS since the NWHacks 2016 hackathon which was 2 weeks ago.

Aman however is fresh to web development, and contributed mainly to UI design & user interaction, but is proud to have learned a lot
about how javascript works and especially react.

PS We are both looking for our first co-op opportunities :)
